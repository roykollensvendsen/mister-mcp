"""A freshly started server lists its tools quickly, and never needs the MiSTer to do it.

The bridge starts each plugin as a process of its own and asks it for its tools.
A plugin that does not answer in time is not offered (claude-voice PR 162 waits
60 seconds; it waited 15 before). So listing the tools must not wait on the
MiSTer, the TV or the network: a MiSTer that is switched off must still leave
the voice a plugin that says so. Both runs here start the real command, as the
bridge does, from a process that has never imported the package.
